"""
lift_moment_distribution <: Action

Solves for the aerodynamic force distribution at each step.

NOTE: THIS ACTION DOES NOT SOLVE THE VORTEX LATTICE. Call `solve_wing_CF` prior to calling this action.

Inputs:

* `aircraft::Aircraft` : `Aircraft` system object
* `parameters<:Parameters` `Parameters` struct
* `freestream::Freestream` : `Freestream` object
* `environment::Environment` `Environment` object
* `steprange::AbstractArray` : array of steps for which the simulation is run
* `stepi::Int` : index of the current step
* `stepsymbol::String` : defines the step, e.g. `alpha` or `time`

`parameters <: Parameters` requires the following elements:

* `cfs::Vector{Array{Float64,2}}` : vector with length equal to the number of lifting surfaces, each member containing an array of size (3,nspanwisepanels) of force coefficients cd, cy, cl
* `cms::Vector{Array{Float64,2}}` : vector with length equal to the number of lifting surfaces, each member containing an array of size (3,nspanwisepanels) of moment coefficients cmx, cmy, cmz
* `cls::Vector{Array{Float64,2}}` : each element is an array of size (nspanwisepanels, nsteps) containing local lift coefficients at each lifting line section, corresponding to each lifting surface
* `cds::Vector{Array{Float64,2}}` : each element is an array of size (nspanwisepanels, nsteps) containing local drag coefficients at each lifting line section, corresponding to each lifting surface
* `cys::Vector{Array{Float64,2}}` : each element is an array of size (nspanwisepanels, nsteps) containing local side force coefficients at each lifting line section, corresponding to each lifting surface
* `cmxs::Vector{Array{Float64,2}}` : each element is an array of size (nspanwisepanels, nsteps) containing local x-axis (roll) moment coefficients at each lifting line section, corresponding to each lifting surface
* `cmys::Vector{Array{Float64,2}}` : each element is an array of size (nspanwisepanels, nsteps) containing local y-axis (pitch) moment coefficients at each lifting line section, corresponding to each lifting surface
* `cmzs::Vector{Array{Float64,2}}` : each element is an array of size (nspanwisepanels, nsteps) containing local z-axis (yaw) moment force coefficients at each lifting line section, corresponding to each lifting surface
